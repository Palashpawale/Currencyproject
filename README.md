### Check package.json for dependencies######

#### Currency Calculation UI has select for selecting type of currency with option at both ends with Input for accepting input from user. ###


#### UI is simple but logical operations are working just fine there can be issues while displaying the current Rates in Tablular Tables ##(Some problem can arise with the APIs) ###
